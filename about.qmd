## {{< fa person-chalkboard title="explain" >}} My Profession

I'm the educator/practitioner who is passionate about data science and teaching. I have been teaching data science courses for the past 12 years. I have taught over thousands of students. I have taught students from different backgrounds and different levels in different countries.

My background is in applied statistics -- I was fortunate enough to obtain my undergraduate degree, master degree and my PhD degree all under various scholarships.

I have been working in both the banking and education industry. Both are very fascinating and challenging. In reality, the practical side of statistics is very different from the theoretical side. I constantly need to learn new things and keep up with the latest technology. I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to work in both industries.

## {{< fa cake-candles title="baking" >}} My Passion

I adore baking! I enjoy trying out new recipes and serving my creations to loved ones. I also like to read productivity books since I think they are encouraging and inspirational. Other than this, I am a pretty boring person who dislike socializing. I would rather stay in, have a cup of hot chocolate, and do my own thing. Socialize consumes much of my energy and I feel wear out after that. It's been a year since I first learned about minimalism, but I'm making a sincere effort to live one. Since I enjoy shopping, I'm still learning and getting used to this new way of life. Regretfully, minimalism design and shopping are two extremely contradicting ideas and I am still trying to find a balance between these two ideas.
