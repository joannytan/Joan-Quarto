<!-- ::: {.small-text} -->
Hello, I am Joan, a passionate data analyst who is dedicated to exploring the world of data and discovering insights that can drive positive change. I have always been fascinated by the power of data to tell stories and reveal patterns. I love nothing more than diving into complex data sets and using the skill in programming, statistics, and machine learning to extract meaningful insights. I hope to inspire others to embrace the power of data and use it to make a difference to your career.

When I arenâ€™t busy exploring the world of data science, I enjoy spending my free time pursuing other passions. I love Baking! I loves nothing more than experimenting with new recipes and sharing my creations with friends and family. I also enjoy reading productivity books, which I find inspiring and motivating. I believes that by learning from the experiences of others and adopting new strategies for managing time and staying focused, I can be more effective in all aspects of my life. Whether I am in the kitchen or curies up with a good book, I always seeking new ways to challenge myself and grow as a person.

<!-- ### hi there!     -->

<!-- I'm Sam (and my last name is pronounced "chick"). I'm the Data Training Coordinator at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS) located at UC Santa Barbara, where I'm working to develop and teach data science training curricula for the [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) (MEDS) program and other data science initiatives across NCEAS and UCSB. I am also a co-organizer of [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/), a local data science group which works to promote gender diversity in the R community. In my spare time, you'll typically find me hiking with my pup or cooking family dinners with friends. -->
